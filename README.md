## Get Twig. Use Twig. Smile.

Three example themes for you to play with:-
- **Twig** - Uses Twig via the Timber plugin. Includes an integrated styleguide via Spress.
- **Child** - Child of Twig theme, demonstrates how you can override twig templates in child themes.
- **Normal** - Same design as the Twig theme but no Twig.

## Getting up and running

- Install the Timber plugin [https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/)
